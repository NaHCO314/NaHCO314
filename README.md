My name is nahco314, I am 17 years old, Japanese and I live in Tokyo.

### Languages
I'm good at Python, Rust and TypeScript (I don't like TS tho).

In terms of natural language, (of course) I speak Japanese. I understand some English, but basically use translation.

### Interests
I am interested in processing (parsing, formatting, typing, static analyzing) programming languages.
